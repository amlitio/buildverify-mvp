## Post-Launch Monitoring

### Week 1: Daily Checks

**Metrics to Monitor:**
```
â”œâ”€ New signups: ___ per day
â”œâ”€ Invoices verified: ___ per day
â”œâ”€ Error rate: < 1%
â”œâ”€ Average processing time: < 10 seconds
â”œâ”€ OpenAI costs: $___
â””â”€ User feedback: ___/5 stars
```

**Check These Daily:**
- [ ] Application is accessible
- [ ] No errors in Vercel logs
- [ ] Supabase database healthy
- [ ] OpenAI API working
- [ ] Email notifications sending (if enabled)

### Week 2-4: Weekly Checks

- [ ] Review user feedback
- [ ] Check cost trends
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Fix reported bugs
- [ ] Add requested features

---

## Troubleshooting Production Issues

### Issue: Application won't load

**Check:**
1. Vercel deployment succeeded?
2. Environment variables set?
3. DNS configured correctly?
4. SSL certificate active?

**Fix:**
```bash
# Redeploy
vercel --prod --force

# Check logs
vercel logs
```

### Issue: AI verification failing

**Check:**
1. OpenAI API key valid?
2. Account has credits?
3. Rate limits exceeded?

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test API key
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Add credits at platform.openai.com
```

### Issue: Database errors

**Check:**
1. Supabase project active?
2. Connection pooling limits?
3. RLS policies blocking queries?

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check active connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

-- Verify RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies;
```

## Scaling Triggers

### When to upgrade Supabase:

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 500MB database
- 1GB file storage
- 50,000 monthly active users

**Upgrade when you hit:**
- [ ] 400MB+ database size
- [ ] 800MB+ storage
- [ ] 40,000+ monthly users

### When to optimize costs:

**OpenAI usage:**
- [ ] Spending > $100/month
- [ ] Consider caching common analyses
- [ ] Batch similar invoices

**Database queries:**
- [ ] Response time > 1 second
- [ ] Add more indexes
- [ ] Optimize queries

---

## Backup Procedures

### Weekly Backups

```bash
# 1. Database backup (automatic in Supabase)
# Dashboard â†’ Database â†’ Backups

# 2. Code backup (automatic with git)
git push origin main

# 3. Environment variables backup
# Save .env.local to secure location (1Password, etc.)
```

### Disaster Recovery

**If Supabase goes down:**
1. Supabase has 99.9% uptime SLA
2. Automatic failover to read replicas
3. Data backed up daily

**If Vercel goes down:**
1. Vercel has 99.99% uptime
2. Deploy to backup (Netlify, Railway)
3. Use same codebase

---

## Performance Optimization

### After 100 users:

```typescript
// Add caching
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis'

const redis = new Redis({
  url: process.env.REDIS_URL,
  token: process.env.REDIS_TOKEN
})

// Cache AI results
const cached = await redis.get(`invoice:${id}`)
if (cached) return cached

const result = await aiService.verify(invoice)
await redis.set(`invoice:${id}`, result, { ex: 3600 })
```

### After 1,000 users:

```typescript
// Add queue system
import { Queue } from 'bullmq'

const verificationQueue = new Queue('verifications')

// Add to queue instead of processing immediately
await verificationQueue.add('verify', {
  invoiceId: id,
  files: files
})

// Process in background worker
```
